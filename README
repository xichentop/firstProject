This is a group project I completed with Michael Haeger and Krista Watkins in Ling 570 Shallow Processing Techniques in Fall 2016. 
It is an NLP system which ranks and classifies tourist sites based on web info, and it summarizes site descriptions. 
I was mainly in charge of building the categorizer which utilizes Mallet MaxEnt trainer to categorize tourist sites.
